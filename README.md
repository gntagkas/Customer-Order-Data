# Customers - Orders Data

We created a simple database with three tables: customers, orders, and order_items.

After setting up the database and creating the three tables, we populated them with data from the provided .txt files.

Then, we answered basic queries, which are documented as comments above the corresponding SQL code.

## Technologies Used
- **Visual Studio Code** for development.
- **PostgreSQL** for managing the database and performing data analysis.
